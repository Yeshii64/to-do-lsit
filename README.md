<h1>TODO LIST</h1>
<h3>Todo list to write your tasks on. Includes a colour changing background!</h3>
<h5>You can add, and delete your tasks. If you exit the tab the computer will remember the task you add! This is my first time using javascript in a full application like this, so it was hard to grasp some concepts. Some of the things that I used are arrays, for loops.</h5>
